# Customer Segmentation and Retention Analysis
This project analyzes customer behavior to uncover retention challenges and segment users based on purchasing patterns using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model.  
Key performance metrics including churn rate, retention rate, and customer lifetime value were derived to assess engagement levels.

# Business Problem
TrendyCart is acquiring thousands of new customers through ads and social campaigns, but many only purchase once and never return.
Repeat purchase rates are low, and customer acquisition costs are rising, squeezing profit margins. The leadership team lacks clarity on which customers are most valuable and which are silently disengaging.

# The Need To Act
TrendyCart is at risk losing their best customers and will need to spend more just to replace them.
Retaining just 5% more high-value customers can boost profits by up to 25–95%, according to industry benchmarks.

This dashboard provides the clarity needed to:

• Spot high-risk churn early.
• Prioritize loyal customers for upsell or loyalty programs.
• Reduce spend wastage and improve marketing ROI.

# Business Objectives

• Segment TrendyCart’s customers based on value,frequency, and recency of purchases.

• Identify patterns in customer churn and retention behavior.

• Monitor repeat purchase rates.

• Uncover actionable insights to boost retention, re-engagement, and revenue.

# ANALYSIS & INSIGHTS
 
# Insight 1
**TrendyCart’s growth is driven by first-time buyers, not repeat customers**

 <img width="569" height="407" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59a2cf21-2937-472e-8c6f-6d9a9f86968d" />


The volume of new customers is significantly higher than returning customers, while the repeat purchase rate remains low. 
This indicates that most customers complete only a single transaction and fail to re-engage.
Only 3 out of every 10 customers return to make a second or morepurchases, which signals weak customer retention.

Heavy reliance on new customers increases acquisition costs and limits lifetime value. Without improving repeat behavior, TrendyCart must continuously spend more to maintain revenue levels.

**Recommendations:**

1. Launch Post-Purchase Engagement Campaigns:

• Use email/SMS follow-ups, reorder reminders, or personalized product suggestions to bring back one-time buyers.

• Include time-sensitive discount codes (e.g., “10% off your next order in 7 days”).

2. Implement a Loyalty/Rewards Program:

• Reward points for repeat purchases, referrals, or reviews to incentivize repeat behavior.

• Highlight benefits clearly during checkout or in follow-up emails.

3. Analyze First-Time Purchase Experience:

• Investigate whether product quality, delivery time, or UX issues are preventing repeat purchases (via surveys, reviews).

• Improve onboarding, post-purchase service, and return policies.

4.Upsell & Cross-sell Strategically:

On confirmation and thank-you pages, showcase complementary products to drive basket expansion and encourage future visits.

# Insight 2
**Revenue contribution is highly concentrated among repeat buyers**

<img width="958" height="921" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a572bc67-7286-45db-9e3d-c5b2228cb390" />

Frequent Buyers contribute the highest revenue.
Although repeat customers make up a smaller share of the customer base, they contribute a large share of total revenue.
Losing even a small number of loyal customers would have a greater revenue impact than losing many one-time buyers.

**Recommendations:**

• Flag high-value repeat customers in CRM.

• Protect this segment from aggressive discounting.

• Prioritize them for loyalty programs, early access, and personalized offers

# Insight 3
**Clear behavioral differences exist between loyal, new, and at-risk customers**
 
<img width="1002" height="819" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac8d985a-4b8c-4844-b857-ee6151992ae9" />


At-Risk and Need Attention groups are large: Combined, they make up 824 customers, signaling significant disengagement or early signs of churn.
 
RFM segmentation reveals distinct groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, New Customers, and At-Risk customers, each with very different purchasing behaviors.
Applying the same marketing strategy across all segments leads to wasted spend and missed revenue opportunities.

**Recommendations:**

1. Double Down on Frequent Buyers

• Reward them with exclusive offers, early product access, or a loyalty tier.

2. Champion & Big Spender Appreciation

• Create VIP experiences, personalized thank-you emails, and upsell premium products.

• Keep them engaged with birthday offers, feedback requests, and tailored deals.

3. Prevent Revenue Leakage from At Risk & Need Attention

• These segments still generate over $128K combined, launch retention emails, time-limited offers, or personal check-ins.

• Consider cart abandonment and product recommendation emails for reactivation.


# Insight 4
**Early Behavior Signals Churn: One-Time Purchases and High-Risk RFM Segments**

<img width="854" height="541" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c30b89a1-34c3-49a7-90f6-653df3c84fa8" />

<img width="915" height="860" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/115b760c-d9b1-417c-8220-ed0bd6b41105" />

 

Customer churn is strongly driven by lack of repeat behavior, and it can be predicted early using RFM segmentation.
One-time purchase behavior is the strongest churn signal.
The majority of churned customers purchased only once.
In contrast, repeat customers overwhelmingly remain active.
This shows that churn risk emerges immediately after the first purchase, not months later.

**RFM segmentation** clearly separates high-risk and healthy customers
Customers in Need Attention, Lost, and At Risk segments show a 100% churn rate, indicating complete disengagement.
Even high-value segments like Big Spenders and Frequent Buyers show very high churn (94–97%), suggesting that value alone does not guarantee loyalty.
On the other hand, Recent Customers, Potential Loyalists, and Champions show 0% churn, proving that recency and engagement are strong retention drivers.

High-risk customers can be identified early.
Customers who remain one-time buyers and fall into declining RFM segments can be flagged before churn becomes permanent.
Churn is not random or sudden, it builds over time. This gives the business a window to intervene before customers become fully disengaged.
Proactive retention instead of reactive win-back efforts.

**Recommendations:**

• Convert one-time buyers quickly by focusing on first-to-second purchase campaigns, as one-time customers show the highest churn risk.

• Use RFM segmentation as an early-warning system to identify customers entering high-risk segments (Need Attention, At Risk) and trigger timely re-engagement.

• Proactively retain high-value customers (Big Spenders, Frequent Buyers) when signs of declining activity appear, rather than assuming they are safe.

• Strengthen loyalty strategies for low-churn segments (Champions, Potential Loyalists) by reinforcing engagement and encouraging repeat purchases.


# Insight 5
**Repeat Purchase Behavior Is the Key Driver of Customer Retention**

<img width="786" height="494" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cfaa2d3-3931-4994-ab31-a10db087e822" />


Customer retention is strongly driven by repeat purchase behavior, but while high-value and loyal segments remain stable, overall retention has not fully recovered to previous levels, signaling untapped repeat purchase potential in mid-tier segments.

• Repeat purchase behavior defines retention success

• Customers who make repeat purchases overwhelmingly remain active.

 •One-time buyers account for most churned customers, highlighting that failure to convert after the first purchase leads directly to disengagement.

Retention strength varies sharply by RFM segment:

• Champions and Frequent Buyers show perfect retention (100%), confirming that high frequency and strong engagement lock in loyalty.

• Potential Loyalists and Recent Customers show partial retention, indicating customers who are engaged but not yet fully committed.

• Need Attention and At Risk segments show early signs of disengagement, where repeat behavior is declining.

Retention rate is recovering but remains fragile.

<img width="1242" height="694" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2befae2a-4542-45a6-98e0-c64eb1e72bf0" />



Retention dropped significantly in 2023 and has only partially rebounded.

The slow recovery suggests that while loyal customers are being retained, new and mid-tier customers are not converting into repeat buyers at the same pace.


# Insight 6
**Retention Is Driven More by Post-Acquisition Engagement Than Acquisition Channel**

<img width="1008" height="754" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12815144-501b-447a-a49c-fdad35c49b58" />


Retention rates are remarkably similar across acquisition channels, with only a narrow range between the highest (Social Media & Email at 32%) and the lowest (Organic & Paid Ads at 28%). 
This suggests that no single channel is driving significantly stronger long-term customer loyalty.

Overall, retention appears to be less dependent on where customers come from and more influenced by post-acquisition engagement strategies.

**Recommendations**

• Double down on Email and Social Media retention strategies, as these channels show slightly stronger repeat behavior and allow continuous engagement.

• Improve post-purchase nurturing for Paid Ads and Organic customers to increase their repeat purchase rate.

• Shift focus from channel-level performance to lifecycle optimization, ensuring all acquired customers receive consistent retention-focused touchpoints.


**Expected Impact  of the Recommendations**

If implemented, insights from this dashboard are expected to drive impact across revenue, cost efficiency, and customer lifetime value.

1. Improved Customer Retention.
    
2. Increased Revenue Without Higher Acquisition Spend.

3. More Efficient Marketing Spend.

4. Faster, Data-Driven Decision Making.

**In Summary,** this project focuses on understanding customer behavior beyond first purchase for an e-commerce business experiencing low repeat rates and rising acquisition costs.
Using customer transaction data, the analysis:

• Segmented customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics

• Identified high-value, at-risk, and churned customers

• Analyzed repeat purchase behavior and inactivity patterns

• Connected retention insights directly to revenue impact

The dashboard was designed not just to describe performance, but to highlight where the business should act to improve retention, reduce churn, and grow revenue sustainably.

# Conclusion
While acquiring new customers fuels growth, the real value lies in retention. 
With 70% of shoppers buying just once, improving repeat customer strategies could drastically increase revenue without increasing ad spend.
Ultimately, the dashboard shifts decision-making from reactive acquisition to proactive retention, enabling the business to grow smarter, not just bigger.
